### Introduction
Purpose of the document:
	This Document will provide a better understanding of the future tests. 
Scope of the tests
	This tests are very important for understanding and observing the weakest parts of our applications, to find the potential bugs and understanding what do we have to change before this problems will become a big stopholders for the project.
### Test Environment Setup
 Required software and tools:
1. Trello - in our project is used to manage all types of testing and other activities. Here is the representation of our list bar:

| To Do | Pivotal | In Progress | Testing | On Hold | Done | Presented | To Read |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- | ------- | ------- | ---- | --------- | ------- |
For Tests are used next cards: 
- **Testing** (for those tasks that are in Testing phase right now);
- **On Hold** (if a specific Test will be provided later)
- **Done** (if a piece of project was developed and tested it comes here)

### Functional Tests
1. **User Registration and Login**
- Verify user can register using Metamask
- Ensure wallet connection prompts as expected.
- Verify the reasons for invalid results
2. **NFT Creation and Minting**
- Check minting with various formats (image, video, audio)
- Validate smart contract interaction
- Tests the requirements for Minting
3. **Listing NFTs**
- Verify listing of NFTs for fixed price 
4. **Payment Integration**
- Test Metamask payment integration
- Should be Done before Buying and Selling
5. **Buying and Selling**
- Ensure user can buy an NFT 
- Verify Payment was succed
### Security Tests
1. **Smart Contract Security**
- Verifying the proper work of the Smart Contract
- Check if there are possibilities to outcome the smart contract in your favor
2. **Data Protection**
- Check if the Data is secured from possible hacking 
### Performance Tests
1. **Load Testing**
- Simulate high traffic to test the systemâ€™s response.
2. **Response Time**
- Record average transaction processing time.
3. **Scalability Testing**
- Assess performance under different load sizes.
### User Interface (UI/UX) Tests

### Integration Tests
### Regression Tests
- Re-run critical tests after updates to the platform or contracts.
### Best Practices and Recommendations
Verify if the Best Practices were provided for the project (expecially Front-End)

### Test Plan for Functional Testing
### Test Cases
