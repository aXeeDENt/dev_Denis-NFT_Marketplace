# Testing Documentation for PBL (NFT Markeplace)
### Introduction
Purpose of the document:
	This Document will provide a better understanding of the future tests. 
Scope of the tests
	This tests are very important for understanding and observing the weakest parts of our applications, to find the potential bugs and understanding what do we have to change before this problems will become a big stopholders for the project.
### Test Environment Setup
 Required software and tools:
1. Trello - in our project is used to manage all types of testing and other activities. For tests are used next cards from the list bar: 
- **Testing** (for those tasks that are in Testing phase right now);

- **Done** (if a piece of project was developed and tested it comes here)

| To Do | Pivotal | In Progress | Testing | On Hold | Done | Presented | To Read |
